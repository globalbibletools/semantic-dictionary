              <Comments>In a number of languages it may be important to translate χειμών[a] as simply ‘the time of the cold rains.’ Such rains may actually occur during the growing season or as a part of the rainy season. In semi-tropical areas, however, the cold rains do normally occur in what is regarded as the winter, while the warm rains occur in the summer. See also discussion at {D:67.163}.</Comments>

              <Comments>The principal difficulty involved in translating χειμών[b] is the fact that in so many languages there are quite distinct terms for various kinds of bad weather or storms. Furthermore, the location of such bad weather will also influence significantly the terms which may be used. For example, stormy weather over the open sea may require quite a different term from what would be used in speaking of a similar kind of storm over the land. In addition, storms which are accompanied by rain may also be referred to by different terms from those which involve wind without rain. Accordingly, one must carefully examine each biblical context in which χειμών[b] is employed and determine what would be the most satisfactory expression in the receptor language. For example, in {S:04001600300008} the reference is to a windstorm accompanied by clouds and moving over land, while in {S:04402702000020} the reference is to a storm of long duration which takes place over a body of water.</Comments>
