              <Comments>In a number of languages the use of ἀναγεννάω in the sense of ‘to be born again spiritually’ is extremely difficult for people to understand, even as it was in biblical times. However, the concept is such an integral element in so much NT thought and teaching that the expression should be retained, though it may very well require some brief marginal explanation or at least significant cross-referencing.|In its NT usage ἀναγεννάω, of course, has nothing to do with birth as such, but refers to a radical change in personality, with the attendant change in state, and it is for that reason that ἀναγεννάω is here classified in Domain 13 Be, Become, Exist, Happen.
