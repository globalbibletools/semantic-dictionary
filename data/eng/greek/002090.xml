God will judge them. But should you not judge the members of your own fellowship? As the scripture says, ‘Remove the evil man from your group.’ ”</Comments>

              <DefinitionLong/>
              <DefinitionShort>(an idiom, literally: the inner (person)) the psychological faculty, including intellectual, emotional, and spiritual aspects, in contrast with the purely physical aspects of human existence</DefinitionShort>

              <Comments>In a number of languages it is quite impossible to speak of the psychological faculty of a person as being merely ‘that which is within.’ It is frequently necessary to refer to a particular organ of the body, for example, ‘the heart’ or ‘the liver’ or ‘the spleen.’ In some languages, however, one may refer to this faculty as being ‘the person who stands inside’ or ‘the real person’ or even ‘the other person.’|In {S:04201702100026} the phrase ἐντὸς ὑμῶν in the statement ἰδοὺ γὰρ ἡ βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ ἐντὸς ὑμῶν ἐστιν ‘look, God’s reign is within you’ may constitute a reference to the same inner being designated by the phrases ὁ ἔσω and ὁ ἐν τῷ κρυπτῷ. On this basis some scholars have suggested that the phrase ἐντὸς ὑμῶν can be interpreted as a potentiality for participation and hence be translated ‘within your grasp,’ but it is more likely that one should understand the phrase ἐντὸς ὑμῶν in {S:04201702100026} as a spacial relationship, for example, ‘in your midst’ or ‘among you’ (see {D:83.9}).</Comments>
