      <Content>One would assume that ἀνάκειμαι[b] and κατάκειμαι[c] would have almost opposite meanings in view of the prefixes ἀνα and κατα. It is, of course, possible that ἀνάκειμαι[b] refers to being propped up on a couch where one was eating and κατάκειμαι[c] refers specifically to reclining, that is to say, lying down, but the contexts in which these two expressions occur do not provide a clear basis for such a distinction in meaning. In fact, the two are largely generalized to simply mean to eat a meal, though their etymological history may be significantly different.</Content>

              <Comments>In biblical times there were apparently three different positions involved in the eating of a meal. People might, for example, (1) be seated on cushions around a low table or (2) be seated on chairs around a table or (3) recline on couches facing a table. Meals which involved reclining on couches would normally have been more elaborate, but the verbs ἀνάκειμαι[b] and κατάκειμαι[c] have been generalized in meaning to denote the eating of a meal without necessarily specifying the particular reclining position of those who participated in the meal.|For the translator, it may be extremely awkward to speak of ‘reclining to eat,’ since this may have connotations of people who are too lazy to sit up at the table or who are too sick to partake of an ordinary meal. It is for that reason that instead of rendering ἀνάκειμαι[b] or κατάκειμαι[c] as ‘to recline to eat,’ translators use expressions such as ‘to sit down to eat’ or ‘to eat a meal.’</Comments>

              <DefinitionShort>(an idiom, literally: to recline on the bosom) to take the place of honor at a meal</DefinitionShort>

              <Comments>These expressions in {S:04301302300004} and {S:04301302500002} would mean that the so-called ‘beloved disciple’ would be at the right of Jesus, since guests at a meal would be reclining on the left side so as to permit freedom of the right hand in dining. It may, of course, be that the same expression could be used of persons sitting at a table rather than reclining on couches.|Literal translations of ἀνάκειμαι ἐν τῷ κόλπῳ and ἀναπίπτω ἐπὶ τὸ στῆθος can result in serious misunderstanding, since they might imply overt homosexuality. There is no justification for reading into such idioms this type of implication.</Comments>
