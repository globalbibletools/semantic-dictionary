              <Comments>See {D:14.13}.|In Palestine the rainy season differs appreciably from what it is in many other parts of the world. In tropical regions north of the Equator, the rains occur primarily from May through October, and in the tropical regions below the Equator, the rains normally occur from November through April. The other seasons of the year are normally quite dry. In Palestine, however, rains occur primarily during the months of November through March, and the summer months are often without rain. Because of this significant difference in the time of rainfall, it may be important to relate the early and late rains not to particular times of the year but to the normal period for rain. For example, the early rains could be ‘rain coming before it is normally expected’ or ‘rain at the beginning of the rainy season,’ and late rains are ‘rains which come later than what one expects’ or ‘rain at the end of the rainy season.’ On the other hand, the contrast may be expressed as ‘rain coming before it should’ or ‘rain coming later than it should.’ It is difficult to relate early and late rains to so-called ‘growing seasons,’ since in the Middle East grains grow primarily during the rainy season and are harvested early in the spring, while fruits and vegetables are grown in the spring and summer with extensive use made of irrigation.</Comments>
