      <Content>There are significant differences of opinion with regard to the nature of λέπρα as mentioned in the NT. Some authorities insist that this type of disease is not in any way related to so-called Hansens disease, while others assume that it does include Hansens disease as well as a number of other skin ailments, including psoriasis, seborrhea, and pinto (a white, spotted discoloration of the skin). From the standpoint of the biblical text, the factor of ritual uncleanness or impurity was even more important than the physical malady.</Content>
