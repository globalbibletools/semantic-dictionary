      <Content>It is possible that the phrase γένημα τῆς ἀμπέλου product of the grapevine ({S:04002602900024}) should be clssified as a fixed phrase meaning wine, but it is also possible to treat this phrase as semantically endocentric (that is, non-idiomatic), in which case the reference could potentially be either grapes or wine.</Content>

      <Content>Though the various terms for wine and olive oil might very well be treated simply in the category of Food (Domain 5), they obviously served other functions as well, for wine was used medicinally as an antiseptic and olive oil was used not only for food but also for illumination in lamps. Since both the production of wine and olive oil involved relatively elaborate processes, it therefore seems best to classify them as artifacts rather than subsume them under various functional categories.</Content>

      <Content>The term ἐσμυρνισμένος οἶνος can be seen as semantically endocentric (σμυρνίζω, ‘mixed with myrrh’ and οἶνος, ‘wine’). However, due to its specific role in the passage of {S:04101502300008}, it was included in this semantic field.</Content>

              <DefinitionShort>a fermented beverage made from the juice of grapes{N:001}</DefinitionShort>

              <Comments>Though some persons have argued that whenever mention is made of Jesus either making or drinking wine, one must assume that this was only unfermented grape juice, there is no real basis for such a conclusion. Only where οἶνος νέος ‘new wine’ ({D:6.198}) is mentioned can one assume that this is unfermented grape juice or grape juice in the initial stages of fermentation.|In a number of languages there is no indigenous term for wine, and some expression may simply be borrowed from a dominant language. On the other hand, it is sometimes possible to employ a descriptive phrase, for example, ‘fermented fruit juice.’ In some languages the equivalent for ‘wine’ is more specifically ‘palm wine,’ that is to say, a wine made from the sap of certain palm trees. Such a term may also have a more generic meaning and be applicable to any kind of wine.|There are a number of passages in the NT where one must be particularly careful in the selection of terms to translate wine. For example, in {S:04900501800008} a literal translation of ‘do not get drunk with wine’ could be interpreted to mean that it is permissible for one to get drunk on other types of intoxicating liquors. It may, therefore, be necessary in some languages to render {S:04900501800008} as simply ‘do not get drunk.’|In {S:04201003400020} (κατέδησεν τὰ τραύματα αὐτοῦ ἐπιχέων ἔλαιον καὶ οἶνον ‘he poured on olive oil and wine and bandaged his wounds’) it is important to recognize the medicinal value of oil and wine. In some instances translators have indicated the purpose of such an activity by translating ‘to cleanse and heal his wounds he poured wine and oil on them and bandaged them.’ It may also be possible to add in a marginal note information as to the antiseptic quality of the wine and the value of the oil in the healing process.{N:002}</Comments>

              <Comments>In general, ἐσμυρνισμένος οἶνος must be rendered by means of a phrase or a clause, for example, ‘wine which has been mixed with a drug called myrrh’ or ‘wine mixed with a drug to reduce pain.’ It is, of course, also possible to use an abbreviated phrase such as ‘myrrhed wine’ and then to place the explanation of its function in a marginal note.</Comments>
