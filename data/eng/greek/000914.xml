              <DefinitionShort>a person not participating in Greek culture and civilization (βάρβαρος contrasts with {L:Ἕλλην&lt;SDBG:Ἕλλην:000000&gt;}[a] ‘Greek,’ {D:11.90}, with the focus on culture rather than on language; see {S:04601401100024} at {D:11.94})</DefinitionShort>

              <Comments>It would be a mistake in the case of {S:04500101400008} to speak merely of ‘Greeks and barbarians’ or ‘Greeks and savages.’ By NT times {L:Ἕλλην&lt;SDBG:Ἕλλην:000000&gt;} (see {D:11.90}) would have included most of those who participated in one way or another in the culture of the Greco-Roman world. Accordingly, one may render the contrast in {S:04500101400008} as ‘the civilized and the uncivilized.’</Comments>

              <Comments>In rendering this expression in {S:04402800200006} it would be possible in some languages to translate ‘the people there who spoke a strange language were friendly to us’ or ‘the local inhabitants of that island were kind to us.’ ἔσομαι τῷ λαλοῦντι βάρβαρος καὶ ὁ λαλῶν ἐν ἐμοὶ βάρβαρος ‘I will be a foreigner to the one who speaks, and the one who speaks will be a foreigner to me’ {S:04601401100036}. In {S:04601401100036} βάρβαρος implies being a foreigner from a country outside of the so-called civilized world.</Comments>

              <Comments>Regardless of the level of culture or civilization, each ethnic group seems to be able to point to some other group regarded as being uncivilized. In some languages such a group is identified as ‘those who live far away’ or ‘those who do not live in towns’ or ‘those who are very strange.’ In {S:05100301100020} {L:Σκύθης&lt;SDBG:Σκύθης:000000&gt;} ‘Scythian’ ({D:93.583}) may represent a state of civilization even lower than that implied by βάρβαρος ‘barbarian.’</Comments>
