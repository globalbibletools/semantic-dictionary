              <Comments>In some areas of the Tropics, there are difficulties involved in arriving at a satisfactory term for θέρος. It may not be possible, for example, to use ‘the warm season,’ since that may refer to the end of a dry season just before the rains begin. Normally, therefore, one can equate θέρος with ‘the rainy season,’ but a context such as {S:04202103000024} may be difficult, for one would not normally say ‘when you see that the trees are putting out leaves, you know that the rainy season is near,’ for trees normally do not put out the leaves until after the rainy season has begun. It may, therefore, be necessary to render {S:04202103000024} as ‘when you see the trees putting out leaves, you know that the time for growth is near’ or ‘… the time for trees to produce fruit.’</Comments>
