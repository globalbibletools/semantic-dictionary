              <Comments>The hyssop bush may reach a height of one meter (three feet) and has a number of woody stems.|In some translations a term for ‘hyssop’ is borrowed with a classifier such as ‘plant,’ for example, ‘a branch of a plant called hyssop.’|In {S:04301902900020} some translators have simply used ‘a twig’ or ‘a branch,’ but this may not be adequate, since some persons see a good deal of symbolism in the use of the term ‘hyssop’ because of its relationship to ritual uses in the OT.|According to an old conjecture, the text of {S:04301902900020} could have contained the term {L:ὑσσός&lt;SDBG:ὑσσός:000000&gt;} ‘javelin’ ({D:6.35}) rather than ὕσσωπος ‘hyssop’ (this reading is actually found in one eleventh century minuscule manuscript), and this has been followed by the NEB translation (“they soaked a sponge with the wine, fixed it on a javelin …”), but this form of the text has very little support and is not recommended.</Comments>
