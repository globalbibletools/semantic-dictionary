              <Comments>In {S:04002100900044} ὡσαννὰ τῷ υἱῷ Δαυίδ may also be rendered as ‘praise to you, Son of David’ or ‘we praise you who are the Son of David’ or ‘… a descendant of David.’|Though for many early Christians, and especially those of Jewish background, ὡσαννά would be known from its Aramaic background as meaning ‘help’ or ‘save,’ nevertheless, its association with liturgical expressions involving praise and exaltation resulted in the expression acquiring quite a different significance; hence, a phrase such as ‘hosanna in the highest’ became equivalent to ‘praise be to God.’ For growing numbers of Christians without Jewish background, ὡσαννά probably acquired much the same meaning as it now has in English.</Comments>
