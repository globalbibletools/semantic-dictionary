              <Comments>Since goats are so widely distributed throughout the world, there is usually little or no difficulty involved in finding a satisfactory term. The difficulty arises, however, in the connotations of the term for goat, especially in contrast with sheep. In contrast with usage in the Bible, in many parts of the tropical world goats are much more highly prized than sheep, because they can forage well for themselves and are appreciated for their meat. Sheep, on the other hand, are often regarded as scavengers and are much less valued. One should not reverse biblical statements about sheep and goats, but marginal notes and a fuller explanation of cultural differences in a glossary are important.</Comments>
