              <Comments>For terms involving ‘disobedience’ or ‘transgression,’ there are often a number of subtle distinctions reflecting several different types of contrasts. For example, there may be important distinctions between disobeying a person and disobeying a law or custom. A number of languages also make a clear distinction between intentional and unintentional disobedience or transgression. Another distinction may involve repeated activity or consistency of attitude, so that the choice of terms may specify whether a person has consistently disobeyed or has only disobeyed once or twice. A further distinction is sometimes made between disobedience of children or those who are mentally incapacitated and the disobedience of those who should know better. Accordingly, in the choice of terms for various passages of Scripture it is extremely important to note the distinctive features of meaning; otherwise, much of the emphasis upon disobedience and transgression as stated in the Scriptures may be seriously distorted.</Comments>
