              <Comments>There are certain problems, however, involved in the rendering of {S:05800401200050}, for strictly speaking there is no one point at which joints and marrow may be separated. Similarly, the expression ‘to where joints and marrow come together’ seems rather anomalous, since the joints bring together various bones, but they are not joined together with marrow. This passage in {S:05800401200050} is essentially figurative in that it is speaking of the word of God being sharper than a two-edged sword cutting all the way through to where soul and spirit meet, and this is described as being parallel to where joints and marrow come together. Perhaps one can best state this in some languages as ‘to where the joints and the marrow are,’ thus suggesting that part of the human body farthest from the surface.</Comments>
