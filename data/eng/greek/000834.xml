              <Comments>In a number of languages one must make a clear distinction in the choice of terms referring to the growth of an animate being (animal or human) and the growth of plants|In {S:05100201900042} αὔξησις is used figuratively in the sense that the reference of ‘body’ is the church rather than a physical body. Normally a term for ‘growth’ would imply not only size but also number, that is to say, the growth of the church would be in terms of the increase of members of the church, though it might refer to spiritual maturity. In some instances, however, it may be necessary to specify ‘growth in numbers’ so as to avoid the implication which might be derived from the context, namely, that the church is simply a building which gets bigger and bigger.</Comments>
