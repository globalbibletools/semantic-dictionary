              <Comments>In their NT contexts, σκηνόω and ἐπισκηνόω are essentially figurative in meaning, for they deal with spiritual existence and residence rather than human residence or dwelling. In translating one should, in so far as possible, try to preserve this important figurative relationship, since it expresses one of the most significant ways in which spiritual and human existence can be combined. In some languages, however, it may be necessary to employ an expression which means simply ‘to be in’ or ‘to continue with,’ since expressions for ‘living’ or ‘dwelling’ may be based upon terms which are too specific in meaning, for example, ‘to eat from the same pot’ or ‘to enter by the same door.’</Comments>
