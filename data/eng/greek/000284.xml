              <Comments>In a number of languages a clear distinction is made between male and female lambs. It is therefore essential in any figurative reference to male persons to employ an appropriate term for lamb. In a number of languages, of course, a lamb is simply referred to as a ‘young sheep’ or ‘child sheep.’|Perhaps the most widespread story about cultural differences in Bible translation is the one which refers to the translation of ‘lamb’ as ‘little seal of God’ in an Eskimo language. However, there is no evidence that this type of rendering was ever used, since in matters of appearance, habitat, and behavior, lambs and little seals have practically nothing in common. Furthermore, Eskimo languages have terms for ‘lamb’ and in some instances, at least, use the expression ‘young, woolly goat,’ since wild goats are well known and wool is well known as an imported product.</Comments>
