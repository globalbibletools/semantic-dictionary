      <Content>One would assume that ἀνάκειμαι[b] and κατάκειμαι[c] would have almost opposite meanings in view of the prefixes ἀνα and κατα. It is, of course, possible that ἀνάκειμαι[b] refers to being propped up on a couch where one was eating and κατάκειμαι[c] refers specifically to reclining, that is to say, lying down, but the contexts in which these two expressions occur do not provide a clear basis for such a distinction in meaning. In fact, the two are largely generalized to simply mean to eat a meal, though their etymological history may be significantly different. See also Domain 17, footnote 8.</Content>

              <Comments>In biblical times there were apparently three different positions involved in the eating of a meal. People might, for example, (1) be seated on cushions around a low table or (2) be seated on chairs around a table or (3) recline on couches facing a table. Meals which involved reclining on couches would normally have been more elaborate, but the verbs ἀνάκειμαι[b] and κατάκειμαι[c] have been generalized in meaning to denote the eating of a meal without necessarily specifying the particular reclining position of those who participated in the meal.|For the translator, it may be extremely awkward to speak of ‘reclining to eat,’ since this may have connotations of people who are too lazy to sit up at the table or who are too sick to partake of an ordinary meal. It is for that reason that instead of rendering ἀνάκειμαι[b] or κατάκειμαι[c] as ‘to recline to eat,’ translators use expressions such as ‘to sit down to eat’ or ‘to eat a meal.’</Comments>
