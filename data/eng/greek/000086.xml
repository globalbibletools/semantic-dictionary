              <DefinitionShort>a place or abode of the dead, including both the righteous and the unrighteous (in most contexts ᾅδης[a] is equivalent to the Hebrew term Sheol)</DefinitionShort>

              <Comments>There are several problems involved in rendering ᾅδης[a] as world of the dead, since in some languages this may be interpreted as suggesting that there are two different earths, one for the living and another for the dead. In such cases, ᾅδης[a] may be more satisfactorily rendered as ‘where the dead are’ or ‘where the dead remain.’|In {S:04201602300008} ᾅδης[a] obviously involves torment and punishment. These aspects are important supplementary features of the word ᾅδης[a] but are not integral elements of the meaning. In {S:04201602300008}, however, it may be appropriate to use a term which is equivalent to Greek {L:γέεννα&lt;SDBG:γέεννα:000000&gt;} meaning hell (see {D:1.21}). It is indeed possible that in addressing a GrecoRoman audience Luke would have used ᾅδης in a context implying punishment and torment, since this was a typical Greco-Roman view of the next world. But since Luke also uses {L:γέεννα&lt;SDBG:γέεννα:000000&gt;}, as in {S:04201200500032}, it is possible that the choice of ᾅδης in {S:04201602300008} reflects Luke’s intent to emphasize the fact that ᾅδης[a] includes both the unrighteous and the righteous.</Comments>

              <DefinitionShort>(a figurative extension of meaning of {L:ᾅδης&lt;SDBG:ᾅδης:000000&gt;}[a] Hades, {D:1.19}, as a personification of the power of Hades as the place of the dead)</DefinitionShort>

              <Comments>In {S:04601505500016} ᾅδη is a variant reading in the apparatus of θάνατε ‘death’ ({D:23.99}).|In some languages it is extremely difficult to personify death except as a reference to some demon which may cause death, but this, of course, is not the reference in this passage. The closest equivalent in some languages is ‘how can death be victorious?’ or ‘death cannot be victorious.’ In some instances it may be necessary to represent the personification as ‘you who cause death,’ and thus this expression in {S:04601505500000} may be translated as ‘you who cause death will not always be victorious’ or ‘… will not in the end be victorious.’</Comments>
