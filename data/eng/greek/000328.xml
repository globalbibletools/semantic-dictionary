      <Content>It is possible that the prefix ἀνα in ἀναζάω[b] could mean to come to life again, but in this particular context the force of repeated action seems to have been lost.</Content>

              <Comments>This word is also found as a variant reading: Χριστὸς καὶ ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἀνέστη καὶ ἀνέζησεν ‘Christ also died, rose, and lives again’ {S:04501400900014} (apparatus).|In a number of languages there is a difficulty involved in formulating some expression for ‘resurrection’ or ‘living again,’ since such a phrase may refer to what is technically known as metempsychosis, that is to say, the rebirth of the soul in another existence, a belief which is widely held in a number of areas of south Asia. This problem may be avoided in some languages by speaking of ‘his body will live again’ or ‘his body will come back to life’ or ‘he will be the same person when he lives again.’|In {S:04201502400018}, ὅτι οὗτος ὁ υἱός μου νεκρὸς ἦν καὶ ἀνέζησεν ‘because this son of mine was dead and he has come back to life,’ the figurative hyperbole may reflect the practice of referring to a person as dead and then coming back to life if he has been completely separated for a time from all family relations, but then has later been discovered alive and well. It is possible, of course, that in {S:04201502400018} the expression is an idiom, but it is more likely to be simply a figurative usage.</Comments>
