      <Content>There are no doubt certain subtle differences of meaning in the various terms listed here as meaning ‘food,’ but it is impossible to determine such distinctions in meaning from NT contexts. Perhaps τροφή and διατροφή are somewhat more generic in meaning and may suggest a greater emphasis upon nourishment. At the same time, βρῶσις[c] and βρῶμα[a] may imply solid substantive food, but it is difficult, if not impossible, to argue for such subtle connotative distinctions in meanings which are essentially generic.</Content>

      <Content>It would also be possible to classify βρῶσις καὶ πόσις in {S:04501401700016} as referring to the events of eating and drinking. The meanings of βρῶσις and πόσις ({D:5.6}) would then be classified under Domain 23 Physiological Processes and States, Subdomain A Eat, Drink.</Content>

      <Content>The term βρῶσις is included at this point since it is essentially similar in meaning to κατιόομαι ({D:2.61}) and is probably to be understood as a figurative extension of meaning of βρῶσις ‘eating’ ({D:23.3}).</Content>

              <Comments>Though ἄριστον[a], δεῖπνον[a], and βρῶσις[b] are highly generic in this usage, it is not necessary to translate these terms by a corresponding generic term in another language, since a more specific term may fit the context more satisfactorily. In fact, a generic term might be quite inappropriate in that it would suggest in the case of {S:04100602100020} that Herod was quite stingy in simply providing an ordinary meal for his officials.</Comments>

              <Comments>Almost all languages have at least a few general terms for food, though these may be derived from verbal expressions meaning essentially ‘that which is eaten.’ In some instances a distinction may be made between ‘that which is chewed’ and ‘that which is drunk,’ and it may therefore be important in certain contexts to speak of food in general by a phrase meaning ‘that which is either chewed or drunk.’ If one fails to include both types of food, the reader might interpret a passage such as {S:04000601100004} as requesting only solid foods.|In the place of a general term or phrase such as ‘that which is eaten’ or ‘that which is consumed,’ some languages generalize the meaning of a particular term. For example, in certain parts of the Orient the term meaning specifically ‘rice’ also refers to ‘food’ in general. In fact, some persons will declare, ‘I have not eaten!’ if they have not had rice as part of a meal. A similar type of meaning has developed in English with respect to ‘bread.’ For example, in rendering {S:04200400400022} (οὐκ ἐπ’ ἄρτῳ μόνῳ ζήσεται ὁ ἄνθρωπος ‘man shall not live by bread alone’) it would be wrong to employ a strictly literal rendering, since this might mean simply that people should not live on a diet consisting solely of bread. The meaning of {S:04200400400022} is, of course, ‘to live means more than merely eating.’</Comments>
