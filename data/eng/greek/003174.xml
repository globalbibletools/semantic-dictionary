              <Comments>In {S:06600101300030} the phrase πρὸς τοῖς μαστοῖς is a reference to the particular location of the gold band which went around the chest and not to the mammary glands as such. In some languages, therefore, it is often preferable to use a phrase such as ‘around his chest’ rather than trying to be more specific, for example, ‘a gold band around his chest at the location of his breasts.’|In translating {S:04201102700048} it is important to use an expression which will be perfectly natural, for example, ‘the breasts that gave you milk’ or ‘the breasts from which you obtained milk.’ In some instances, however, a specific reference to breasts as the source of milk may seem somewhat vulgar, and therefore it may be better to speak of ‘happy is your mother who nursed you.’</Comments>
