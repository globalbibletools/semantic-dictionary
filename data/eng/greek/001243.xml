      <Content>The terms διάβολος and Σατανᾶς appear to function both as titles and as proper names. This results from the fact that the referent in each instance is unique. In the text of the Greek NT Σατανᾶς was traditionally written with an initial capital letter, while διάβολος was normally written with a lower case initial letter, except for the occurrences of Διάβολος in {S:06601200900026} and {S:06602000200022}.</Content>

              <Comments>In a number of languages there is a well known proper name for the Devil as the chief of all demons. In other instances, however, he is given a descriptive name, for example, ‘the ruler of the evil spirits,’ ‘the chief of the demons,’ ‘the truly bad one,’ ‘the left-handed one’ (as the one who is opposed to all which is right or correct), ‘the no-good one,’ ‘the avaricious one.’ In some instances a term for the Devil may be highly idiomatic as, for example, ‘the barking one,’ a reference to the Devil’s presumed activity in animal guise.|Some translators have attempted to construct a term for Devil on the basis of the meaning of the Greek term διάβολος as ‘slanderer.’ This, however, has rarely been advisable, largely because in practically all languages there is a far more relevant way of speaking about the Devil. Other translators have attempted to render the term Devil by simply borrowing the form of the word from a dominant language, but this may also introduce complications, since one cannot always control the manner in which such a term will be understood. In one language, for example, the borrowed term ‘devil’ was identified simply as a small spirit that spreads fever among people, while in another area the borrowed term ended up meaning only a spirit which induces insanity. In this latter instance, the translators finally used an expression for the Devil which meant literally ‘the lord of all sin.’|Some translators have employed for ‘Devil’ the proper name Satan, but this is often not a satisfactory solution. In one language in West Africa, for example, the term Satan had already been borrowed but was understood in the sense of the culture hero of the people and not as a designation for the chief of demons.</Comments>

              <Comments>While in a number of languages the Devil may be spoken of as ‘the chief of the demons,’ sometimes the demons are simply called ‘the spirits of the Devil’ or ‘the servants of the Devil.’|In a number of languages the difficulty in terminology for demons is not the absence of a term, but the abundance of different terms for different kinds of demons, each one of which may be responsible for particular kinds of human behavior, for example, insanity, depression, epilepsy, sex perversion, and violent assault. Sometimes demons are classified as ‘those of the home’ and ‘those of the forest,’ in which case the latter are normally regarded as more violent and virulent. When there is an abundance of different terms for demons and no generic term for all types of demons, one can usually select a class of demons which parallels most closely the descriptions of demon activity in the NT and use such a term with appropriate contextual qualifications so as to suggest that such a term is to be understood in a general sense.|For another interpretation of διάβολος in {S:04300607000030}, see {D:88.124}.</Comments>
