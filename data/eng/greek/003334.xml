              <Comments>From the standpoint of the NT, adultery was normally defined in terms of the married status of the woman involved in any such act. In other words, sexual intercourse of a married man with an unmarried woman would usually be regarded as {L:πορνεία&lt;SDBG:πορνεία:000000&gt;} ‘fornication’ ({D:88.271}), but sexual intercourse of either an unmarried or a married man with someone else’s wife was regarded as adultery, both on the part of the man as well as the woman. In view of the married status of the woman being the determining factor in μοιχάω, {L:μοιχεύω&lt;SDBG:μοιχεύω:000000&gt;}, μοιχάομαι, {L:μοιχεία&lt;SDBG:μοιχεία:000000&gt;}, and related terms ({D:88.277}-{D:88.278}), there is a significant contrast with {L:πορνεύω&lt;SDBG:πορνεύω:000000&gt;} and related expressions ({D:88.271}). {L:πορνεύω&lt;SDBG:πορνεύω:000000&gt;}, however, may be regarded as more generic in meaning, and thus in certain contexts including adultery.|{S:04000503200046} is usually rendered as ‘anyone who divorces his wife for any cause other than fornication makes her guilty of committing adultery,’ presumably on the implication that she would marry someone else, as is implied in the final clause of the verse.</Comments>
