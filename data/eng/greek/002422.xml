              <Comments>In contrast with the prophet who speaks to people on behalf of God, the priest is often defined as one who represents the people before God. In reality, however, the priest is one who is primarily engaged in religious ritual and ceremony in contrast with the prophet, whose primary activity is involved in proclaiming a message. In societies in which there is no organized priesthood and where there are only medicine men or shamans, it has often been possible to translate ἱερουργέω and ἱερατεύω as simply ‘to be God’s shaman.’ Whether such an expression can be used depends very largely upon the connotations associated with shamanism.</Comments>
