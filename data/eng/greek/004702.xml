              <Comments>In translating terms referring to association, one may employ a number of different kinds of expressions, for example, ‘to have something to do with,’ ‘to keep company with,’ ‘to go around with,’ ‘to join in doing things together,’ or ‘to become a companion of.’ Sometimes association is spoken of in terms of the impression made upon others, for example, ‘to be seen often together,’ ‘to be regarded as close friends,’ and even idiomatically as ‘to be another person’s shadow.’|Some scholars interpret συγχράομαι in {S:04300400900042} as denoting the use of the same dishes or utensils, so that one may translate this expression in {S:04300400900042} as ‘Jews do not use dishes together with Samaritans’ or ‘Jews and Samaritans do not use the same dishes.’ Such an interpretation, however, is based upon etymological arguments for which there seems to be no certain justification in general Greek usage.</Comments>
