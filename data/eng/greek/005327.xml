              <Comments>The Greek word φυλακτήριον, both before and during NT times, referred to an object used as a means of protection from evil forces. As such, it constituted a kind of amulet, but in {S:04002300500030} φυλακτήριον is a reference to what was called in Aramaic tephillin, meaning ‘prayers.’ The two phylacteries, one worn on the head and the other on the left arm, were bound on during daily morning prayers. Just what their function seems to have been is not certain. In {S:04002300500030}, Jesus does not condemn the use of such phylacteries, but he does denounce their ostentatious use.</Comments>
