              <Comments>Though ἑρπετόν is often interpreted as referring only to snakes, it also includes in biblical contexts (as the result of the influence of classifications based on Hebrew terminology, as in {S:00100102500000 00100102600000 00100103000000} a number of small four-footed animals as well as snakes, for example, rats, mice, frogs, toads, salamanders, and lizards. However, in the various NT contexts (for example {S:04401001200016 04401100600032 04500102300036 05900300700016} where ‘creeping things’ are contrasted with birds, animals, and fish) it is probably more satisfactory to use a term which designates primarily snakes. In a number of languages a very important distinction is made between four-footed reptiles (such as lizards) and snakes. If such a distinction is made, it is then probably better to use a term which designates only snakes, since a term for ‘animals’ will probably also include lizards.</Comments>
