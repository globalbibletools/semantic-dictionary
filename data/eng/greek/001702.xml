              <DefinitionShort>The meaning of ἐμβατεύω, which occurs only once in the NT, namely, in {S:05100201800026}, is obscure. It may mean more or less literally ‘to set foot upon’ or ‘to enter’ or possibly ‘to come into possession of.’ It may also mean ‘to enter into’ in the sense of to go into detail in treating a subject, but it seems more likely that ἐμβατεύω in {S:05100201800026} is a technical term derived from the mystery religions, and it could be interpreted in the phrase ἅ ἑόρακεν ἐμβατεύων as meaning ‘who enters the sanctuary which he saw in ecstasy’ or ‘taking his stand on what he has seen in the mysteries.’ In view of the context, which speaks of someone being puffed up without cause, one might also render this Greek phrase as ‘by what he saw when he was initiated.’ For further data on this semantically difficult term, see A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament, University of Chicago Press, third edition edited by Danker (BDAG).</DefinitionShort>
