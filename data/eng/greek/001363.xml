              <Comments>Some scholars, however, interpret δικαιόω, δικαίωσις, and δικαιοσύνη in the contexts of {S:04500302400002},  {S:04500402500022}, and {S:04500101700002} as meaning forensic righteousness, that is to say, the act of being declared righteous on the basis of Christ’s atoning ministry; but it would seem more probable that Paul uses these expressions in the context of the covenant relation rather than in the context of legal procedures.|It may be difficult in some languages to find a succinct expression equivalent to ‘to be put right with.’ Sometimes the closest equivalent may be ‘to be related to as one should be.’ In some instances the implication of a right relationship may be expressed by phrases involving ‘acceptance.’ For example, {S:04500302400002} may be expressed as ‘by the free gift of God’s grace they are accepted by him through Christ Jesus who sets them free.’ Similarly, {S:04500402500022} is sometimes expressed as ‘he was raised to life in order to cause us to be accepted by God.’ There are, however, certain dangers involved in terms indicating ‘acceptance,’ since this might imply God’s reluctance to accept people apart from the atoning work of Jesus Christ, while in reality it was God who was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. Therefore, one should clearly avoid a rendering which would seem to suggest different types of motivation in the Godhead.</Comments>

              <Comments>In a number of languages the process of acquittal takes the form of a direct statement, for example, ‘to say, You are not guilty’ or ‘…, You no longer have sin’ or, as expressed idiomatically in some instances, ‘…, Sin is no longer on your head’ or ‘…, Your sins are now given back to you.’</Comments>
