              <Comments>As in the case of the term for ‘bear’ ({D:4.12}), this reference to a leopard occurs in the NT only in {S:06601300200016} and is likewise used as a means of describing the apocalyptic beast. A term referring to a local type of leopard or jaguar would be perfectly appropriate, and in some languages a term referring to a mountain lion has been employed. In other instances the equivalent expression is based upon a phrase meaning ‘fierce, large, cat-like animal.’ A borrowed term may also be employed with a descriptive classifier, for example, ‘an animal called leopard.’</Comments>
